# Merge Sort

Merge Sort is the first algorithm, and also the inspiration for this project, because of how short the code is, compared to the pseudocode in CLRS.

Length of code comparison (including spaces, excluding comments)

| CLRS Pseudocode | Haskell implementation | Python implementation[^1] |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 559 chars       | 369 chars              | 710 chars                 |
