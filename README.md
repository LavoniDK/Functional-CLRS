# Functional-CLRS

In this project i take a functional and declarativ approach to some of the algorithms in the CLRS Textbook. I will implement them in a purely functional language, namely Haskell. 

The motivation to do this, is to explore the functional programming design, and to see how short and concise these algorithms really can be made. 

I will copy the algorithms in terms of input and output whenever possible. For the *in-place* algorithms in the textbook, the output cannot be in-place as functional programming allow for no side-effects, such that the memory ineffeciency is not matched, but maybe the aesthetics of the code will make up for it.
